## 📜 Description:
Developed this project **RxJava Sample Application** to learn more about RxJava and RxAndroid. Implemented the following in this project:
- Operators.
- Cache.
- RxBus.
- Pagination.

Operators Implemented: 
* `Map` -> transform the items emitted by an Observable by applying a function to each item
* `Zip` -> combine the emissions of multiple Observables together via a specified function and emit single items for each combination based on the results of this function
* `Filter` -> emit only those items from an Observable that pass a predicate test
* `FlatMap` -> transform the items emitted by an Observable into Observables, then flatten the emissions from those into a single Observable
* `Take` -> emit only the first n items emitted by an Observable
* `Reduce` -> apply a function to each item emitted by an Observable, sequentially, and emit the final value
* `Skip` -> suppress the first n items emitted by an Observable
* `Buffer` -> periodically gather items emitted by an Observable into bundles and emit these bundles rather than emitting the items one at a time
* `Concat` -> emit the emissions from two or more Observables without interleaving them
* `Replay` -> ensure that all observers see the same sequence of emitted items, even if they subscribe after the Observable has begun emitting items
* `Merge` -> combine multiple Observables into one by merging their emissions
* `SwitchMap` -> transform the items emitted by an Observable into Observables, and mirror those items emitted by the most-recently transformed Observable
